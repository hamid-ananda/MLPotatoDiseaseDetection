# Potato Disease Detection (End-to-End)

An end-to-end Machine Learning project developed to detect diseases (blight) on potato leaves. This project was created to explore and learn Machine Learning and Computer Vision using TensorFlow, with a fully functional website built using Python and ReactJS.

## Features

- Disease detection based on potato leaf images.
- Optimized data processing and visualization for training and evaluation.
- Responsive and interactive frontend for image uploads and results display.

## Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Backend**: Python, TensorFlow Serving
- **Frontend**: ReactJS, Material UI
- **Data**: Kaggle dataset of potato leaf images

## Key Highlights

- **Data Processing**:
  - Acquired a dataset from Kaggle for training and testing.
  - Performed data optimization and visualization using Python.
  - Developed a robust machine learning pipeline for model architecture and training.
  
- **Backend**:
  - Built using Python and TensorFlow Serving to handle predictions efficiently.
  - Designed to integrate seamlessly with the machine learning model.

- **Frontend**:
  - Developed using ReactJS and styled with Material UI for a user-friendly interface.
  - Allows users to upload potato leaf images and receive disease detection results.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamid-ananda/MLPotatoDiseaseDetection.git

## Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the website in your browser.
2. Upload an image of a potato leaf.
3. View the disease detection result on the interface.
